HODOGRAPH:

accel: READY. Looks pretty good.
accel_xy: READY. Looks pretty good.
accel_tang_norm: READY. Looks pretty good.

jerk: READY. Looks pretty good.
jerk_xy: READY. Looks pretty good.
jerk_tang_norm: READY. Looks pretty good.

Allow the user to see jerk and acceleration vectors plotted in the same hodograph at the same time. 
    - Each vector now has its own scale number
    - Give each vector color
    - Make it so that the user can select one vector plus its xy components and the other vector plus it tang/norm components and so on

Some tips to give the user:

To increase fluency of hodograph:
- Use greater step sizes and time steps. This decreases the number of sample points the hodograph must plot at each frame
  and greatly impacts fluency.

CSV FILE FUNCTIONALITY:
READY. Excel and CSV work. Other formats?


There is a bug when the user does no components for accel and xy components for jerk:
  - The xy components of acceleration and not jerk are displayed
  - These components are correctly scaled by the scalar factor of jerk, which is correct. The colors are also correct.
  - Why are the xy and components of accel being computed and displayed tho?
