HODOGRAPH:

accel: READY. Looks pretty good.
accel_xy: READY. Looks pretty good.
accel_tang_norm: READY. Looks pretty good.

jerk: READY. Looks pretty good.
jerk_xy: READY. Looks pretty good.
jerk_tang_norm: READY. Looks pretty good.

Allow the user to see jerk and acceleration vectors plotted in the same hodograph at the same time. 
    - Each vector now has its own scale number
    - Give each vector color
    - Make it so that the user can select one vector plus its xy components and the other vector plus it tang/norm components and so on

CSV FILE FUNCTIONALITY:
READY. Excel and CSV work. Other formats?
