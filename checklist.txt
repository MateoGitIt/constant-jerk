Problems with acceleration vector:

1. The total accel vector is shorter than the tangential component. This tangential component appears to be way too long or to stay constant.
2. The normal component does not look normal to the curve, can use angles to check this. IT IS NORMAL! IT LOOKS WEIRD THOUGH.
3. Like the tangential component, the normal component is longer than the total vector, although it does point in the right direction 
  for both types of curves.

4. Line 28, components.py: why does it work, is the math wrong. 


PROBLEM 1: SOLVED. tangential2 and normal2 work well.
PROBLEM 2: SOLVED. non-square grids shift the angles and make them no longer look normal.
PROBLEM 3: SOLVED. 

Remove X, Y kinematics, and include normal and tangential components of jerk and acceleration. DONE
  - Add a progress bar though, for long curves and small stepsizes, the program starts to take a lot of time.

Besides the button, print out the state of the hodograph to the plot via textbox (magnitude of the plotted components, magnitude of the total vector,
 and angle relative to the curve). 

 In the documentation, mention that if you run the code and see an empty grid, it might be bc you forgot about changing the view bounds.
