Problems with acceleration vector:

1. The total accel vector is shorter than the tangential component. This tangential component appears to be way too long or to stay constant.
2. The normal component does not look normal to the curve, can use angles to check this.
3. Like the tangential component, the normal component is longer than the total vector, although it does point in the right direction 
  for both types of curves.
