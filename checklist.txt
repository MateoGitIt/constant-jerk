HODOGRAPH:

accel: READY. Looks pretty good.
accel_xy: READY. Looks pretty good.
accel_tang_norm:
    - either tangential_accel2 is wrong or t-hat is wrong. Both look right though?
    - why does tangential_accel work well when it's mathematically identical to tangential_accel2?

jerk: 
    - There appears to be a problem in the implementation of the magnitude of the normal jerk
    - This problem comes from "second_term", the variable that calls Udoubleprime
    - The problem potentially lies in calculating Udoubleprime by dividing by h, the step size. Because this calculation
      is done with U_origins, which was shrunk down to fit the number of frames of the hodograph, the horizontal distance
      between each Uprime value is larger than h. Increasing the denominator of this slope calculation should decrease 
      Udoubleprime and yield the real magnitude of the normal jerk. 
    - A note on how we're calculating Udoubleprime: there are three possble slopes for a set of three points. The current implementation
      uses the extreme points for finding an average slope â€“ mean value theorem.
